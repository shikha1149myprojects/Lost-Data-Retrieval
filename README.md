# Ransomware Data Recovery Procedure

###  **Ransomware Data Recovery Procedure Outline**
**Objective:** To restore affected systems from a backup following a ransomware attack and practice data retrieval skills.

**A. Preparation**
   - **Define Scope and Objectives**: Determine the systems and data affected by the ransomware attack.
   - **Assemble Incident Response Team**: Include IT personnel, cybersecurity experts, and relevant stakeholders.

**B. Initial Assessment**
   - **Isolate Affected Systems**: Disconnect infected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
   - **Identify Ransomware Strain**: Analyze the ransomware to understand its encryption methods and potential decryption keys.

**C. Backup Restoration Process**
   - **Verify Backup Integrity**: Ensure that backups are clean and free from ransomware.
   - **Select Appropriate Backup**: Choose the most recent, uninfected backup.
  - **Restore Systems from Backup**:
     - Reimage affected systems.
     - Restore data from the backup to the clean systems.
     - Verify the integrity and completeness of the restored data.
   - **Test Restored Systems**: Ensure systems function correctly and data is accessible.

**D. Post-Restoration**
   - **Update Security Measures**: Apply patches, update antivirus, and improve security protocols.
   - **Monitor Systems**: Continuously monitor for any signs of reinfection.
   - **Document Incident**: Record the incident details, response actions, and lessons learned for future reference.

###  **Plan for Using Data Recovery Tools to Extract Corrupted or Deleted Data**

**Objective:** To build a plan for extracting corrupted or deleted data from storage devices using data recovery tools.

**A. Tool Selection**
   - **Identify Suitable Tools**: Choose reliable data recovery tools (e.g., Recuva, Disk Drill, R-Studio, Photorec).
   - **Acquire Licenses**: Ensure you have necessary licenses for commercial tools.

**B. Preparation**
   - **Set Up Recovery Environment**: Use a clean, isolated environment for data recovery operations.
   - **Backup Existing Data**: Before attempting recovery, back up the current state of the storage device to prevent further data loss.

**C. Data Recovery Process**
   - **Analyze Storage Device**: Use tools to scan and analyze the affected storage device for corrupted or deleted files.
   - **Recover Data**:
     - Perform an initial scan to identify recoverable files.
     - Use advanced recovery options to retrieve as much data as possible.
     - Save recovered data to a secure location.
   - **Verify Recovered Data**: Check the integrity and usability of the recovered files.

**D. Post-Recovery**

   - **Reintegrate Data**: Restore recovered data to the appropriate systems, ensuring it is correctly organized and accessible.
   - **Enhance Storage Practices**: Implement better storage and backup practices to prevent future data loss.
   - **Document Recovery Efforts**: Record the tools used, steps taken, and outcomes achieved during the recovery process.
