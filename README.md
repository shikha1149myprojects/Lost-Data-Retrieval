# Ransomware Data Recovery Procedure

## **Ransomware Data Recovery Procedure Outline**

### **Objective:** 
To restore affected systems from a backup following a ransomware attack and practice data retrieval skills.

### **A. Preparation**
   - **Define Scope and Objectives**: 
     - Identify the specific systems and data that have been affected by the ransomware attack.
     - Set clear objectives for what needs to be restored and the expected outcomes.
   - **Assemble Incident Response Team**: 
     - Gather IT personnel, cybersecurity experts, and relevant stakeholders.
     - Assign roles and responsibilities for each team member.

### **B. Initial Assessment**
   - **Isolate Affected Systems**: 
     - Disconnect infected systems from the network to prevent further spread of the ransomware.
     - Use network segmentation to isolate critical systems.
   - **Identify Ransomware Strain**: 
     - Analyze the ransomware to determine its type, encryption methods, and potential decryption keys.
     - Use tools such as ID Ransomware to help identify the ransomware strain.

### **C. Backup Restoration Process**
   - **Verify Backup Integrity**: 
     - Check backups for any signs of corruption or infection.
     - Ensure that the backups are recent and complete.
     - Utilize backup verification tools to automate this process.
   - **Select Appropriate Backup**: 
     - Choose the most recent backup that is verified to be free from ransomware.
     - Ensure that the selected backup includes all necessary data and configurations.
   - **Restore Systems from Backup**:
     - **Reimage Affected Systems**: Format the affected systems' hard drives and reinstall the operating systems.
     - **Restore Data from Backup**: Use backup software to restore data from the verified backup to the clean systems.
     - **Verify Integrity and Completeness**: Ensure that all data has been restored correctly and is fully operational.
   - **Test Restored Systems**: 
     - Run a series of tests to confirm that the restored systems are functioning correctly.
     - Validate that all applications and services are working as expected.

### **D. Post-Restoration**
   - **Update Security Measures**: 
     - Apply all necessary patches and updates to the operating systems and applications.
     - Update antivirus and anti-malware software.
     - Implement stronger security protocols and configurations.
   - **Monitor Systems**: 
     - Continuously monitor the restored systems for any signs of reinfection or anomalies.
     - Use advanced monitoring tools to detect any suspicious activities.
   - **Document Incident**: 
     - Record all details of the incident, including the ransomware strain, affected systems, recovery steps, and outcomes.
     - Create a detailed report to help improve future incident response strategies.

## **Plan for Using Data Recovery Tools to Extract Corrupted or Deleted Data**

### **Objective:** 
To build a plan for extracting corrupted or deleted data from storage devices using data recovery tools.

### **A. Tool Selection**
   - **Identify Suitable Tools**: 
     - Choose reliable data recovery tools such as Recuva, Disk Drill, R-Studio, and Photorec.
     - Evaluate the features of each tool to ensure they meet the specific recovery needs.
   - **Acquire Licenses**: 
     - Ensure that you have the necessary licenses for commercial tools.
     - Verify that the licenses are up-to-date and valid.

### **B. Preparation**
   - **Set Up Recovery Environment**: 
     - Use a clean, isolated environment for data recovery operations to avoid any contamination.
     - Prepare a dedicated workstation with the necessary recovery tools installed.
   - **Backup Existing Data**: 
     - Before attempting recovery, back up the current state of the storage device to prevent further data loss.
     - Use external storage devices or cloud solutions for this purpose.

### **C. Data Recovery Process**
   - **Analyze Storage Device**: 
     - Use data recovery tools to scan and analyze the affected storage device for corrupted or deleted files.
     - Generate a detailed report of the scan results, highlighting recoverable files.
   - **Recover Data**:
     - **Perform Initial Scan**: Conduct an initial scan to identify all recoverable files.
     - **Use Advanced Recovery Options**: Employ advanced recovery options to retrieve as much data as possible, including deep scans and raw recovery techniques.
     - **Save Recovered Data**: Save the recovered data to a secure location, ensuring no overwriting of existing data.
   - **Verify Recovered Data**: 
     - Check the integrity and usability of the recovered files.
     - Validate that the data is complete and functional.

### **D. Post-Recovery**
   - **Reintegrate Data**: 
     - Restore recovered data to the appropriate systems, ensuring it is correctly organized and accessible.
     - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the data works as intended within the systems.
   - **Enhance Storage Practices**: 
     - Implement better storage and backup practices to prevent future data loss.
     - Regularly update and test backup systems and procedures.
   - **Document Recovery Efforts**: 
     - Record the tools used, steps taken, and outcomes achieved during the recovery process.
     - Create a comprehensive report to help refine future data recovery strategies.
